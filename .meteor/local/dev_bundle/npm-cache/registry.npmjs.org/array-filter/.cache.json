status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/array-filter.png)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/array-filter)\n[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/array-filter.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/array-filter)\n\n[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/array-filter.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/array-filter)\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar filter = require('array-filter');\n\nvar array = [1, 2, 3];\nconsole.log(filter(array, function (el, i, arr) {\n  return false; // I throw it on the ground!\n}));\n// => []\n```\n\n## API\n\n### filter(arr, fn[, self])\n\nReturn an array with elements of `arr` for which `fn` returns a truthy value. `fn` is called with\n\n* `el`: The current element\n* `i`: The element's index\n* `arr`: The whole array\n\nOptionally pass in `self` as the `this` value for `fn`.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do\n\n```bash\n$ npm install array-filter\n```\n\nThen bundle for the browser with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/browserify).\n\n## License\n\n(MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Julian Gruber &lt;julian@juliangruber.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
