                <h3 id="h.k63tb3jsrssb" class="c5"><span class="c4">Information collected automatically</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We receive and store certain types of information whenever you use the Services. Uhs.life automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including Uhs.life cookie information, the page you requested, and other usage information such as your activity on the Services, the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). None of this information constitutes Personal Information. Certain information that is collected automatically, such as device ID, and IP address, will be treated as Personal Information.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We also may provide to our partners aggregate information derived from automatically collected information about how our users, collectively, use our site. We may share this type of non-personally identifiable, aggregated statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services as well as Uhs.life.</span></p>
                <h3 id="h.2157zdu7f1bp" class="c5"><span class="c4">Mobile application</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When users use our mobile application, we automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address, device ID, device type, and what operating system (OS) the user is running.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We collect users&rsquo; IP addresses whenever they use our mobile application, which provides us with a coarse approximation of the user&rsquo;s location at the city level. We will not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission. We may also collect location-based information from users as part of providing the Services and in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the user&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</span></p>
                <h3 id="h.ehfmqzm62cry" class="c5"><span class="c4">Email communications</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you provide us your email address, Uhs.life may send you administrative messages (such as updates, notifications, newsletters, and other news) relating to the Services or to respond to communications from you. By maintaining a Uhs.life account and/or not opting out of receiving information from Uhs.life, you acknowledge and agree that you may receive e-mail on your phone or mobile device from other Uhs.life users, and from Uhs.life. Receiving these messages may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program. If you no longer wish to receive administrative email messages from Uhs.life you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each message or by emailing us at help@uhs.life. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing the legal notices for changes.</span></p>
                <h3 id="h.ibaotp4n0etk" class="c5"><span class="c4">Push notifications</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We send notices to you when a Writer publishes content under a Category or a Club you subscribe to, or when Uhs.life needs to inform you of something. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level. Any user may email us at help@uhs.life if such user no longer wishes to receive communications from the Services.</span></p>
                <h3 id="h.nw6q2ncwo8t0" class="c5"><span class="c4">What about cookies, pixels, and local storage?</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, Uhs.life uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we (or our agents) may use pixels to learn whether you&rsquo;ve interacted with certain web or email content on our Services. This helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on Uhs.life.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with Uhs.life.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Uhs.life uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories:</span></p>
                <p class="c1 c8">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Authentication and security</span></p>
                <ul class="c6 lst-kix_vhikvem28mqv-0 start">
                    <li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">To log you into Uhs.life.</span></li>
                    <li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">To protect your security.</span></li>
                    <li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Uhs.life&rsquo;s policies.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Uhs.life and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c9">Preferences</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">To remember information about your browser and your preferences.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide you with Uhs.life content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Uhs.life. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c9">Analytics and research</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">To help us improve and understand how people use our Services.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Uhs.life by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services&rsquo; features without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by anyone other than Uhs.life is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over those cookies.</span></p>
                <h3 id="h.vsgndqxykng3" class="c5"><span class="c4">Will Uhs.life share any of the personal information it receives?</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Uhs.life relies on its users to provide accurate Personal Information in order to provide our Services. We try our best to protect that information and make sure that we are responsible in handling, disclosing, and retaining your data. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. Uhs.life shares your Personal Information in personally identifiable form as described below.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c9">Agents and third party service providers</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Advertising by companies other than Uhs.life is not permitted on the Services. However, we employ other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and help us provide certain features of our Services, and may need to share your information with those companies in order to provide our Services to you. Some examples of services for which we use agents include sending email or SMS, analyzing data, providing user services, and searching for any security vulnerabilities. These agents may use Personal Information we share with them, for example, to assist us, to provide their services to you and/or us, and to measure and improve the performance of their services. Please see here for further information about the agents we use as part of the Services (including any of their specific terms or policies that are applicable and that may govern use of your information). Uhs.life has reviewed the privacy policies and practices of these agents and third party service providers in order to verify that they are capable of complying with Uhs.life&rsquo;s policies and practices, including those related to the collection, use, transfer, confidentiality, security and integrity of user data. We will review those agents&rsquo; policies and practices at least annually, but you should review them as well. You hereby consent to our sharing of information about you (including, in some cases, Personal Information) for such purposes.</span></p>

                <h3 id="h.ivnxu58wufb4" class="c5"><span class="c4">With your consent</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with agents or companies other than Uhs.life and you will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information unless Uhs.life determines that not disclosing this to you prior to your information being shared is necessary to comply with applicable laws or legal processes or we are prohibited by law or legal processes from informing you in advance.</span></p>
                <h3 id="h.6jhral7h0fwi" class="c5"><span class="c4">Is information about me secure?</span></h3>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The security of personal information in the school environment is a top priority for Uhs.life.</span></p>

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If Uhs.life knows or becomes aware of a security breach of its users&rsquo; personally identifiable information, Uhs.life will notify affected users as required by applicable laws and may post a notice on the Services as required by applicable law(s).
